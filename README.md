## Task description
The task is about Decathlon competition. The input of the Java program is a CSV-like text file (see the attachment in ```src/main/resources/decathlon_input.txt```. The task is to output an XML file with all athletes in ascending order of their places, containing all the input data 
plus total score and the place in the competition (in case of equal scores, athletes must share the places, 
e.g. 3-4 and 3-4 instead of 3 and 4). Input and output file names should be provided as parameters to the Java application 
at the startup. It would be great if an XSL file for viewing the produced XML nicely using a web browser is also provided.
